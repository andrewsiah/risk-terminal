# Algo Risk Terminal

Welcome to our submission for the EthDenver2023 hackathon. We are excited to present Algo Risk Terminal, a robust risk management tool for trading teams in the cryptocurrency market.

## Storyline

Our team has had a successful year in the cryptocurrency market, despite challenges such as Luna, FTX, Mango, and more. From day one, we have understood that risk management is the most critical aspect of trading in this market. Although there is alpha everywhere, with up to 30-300% returns available on yield pages such as OKX, risk management is the key to success, accounting for 80% of trading in crypto.

## Key Aspects of Risk Management

Our risk management approach consists of four critical aspects:

1. **Web3 Risk**: We ensure that the contract is legitimate with minimal counterparty risk. We leverage the expertise of other big names in the market such as Jump, Wintermute, etc. to validate our risk assessment.
2. **Counterparty Risk**: We analyze the general trend when interacting with the protocol for the past few days. We look for significant transfers in or out and determine whether Smart Money is going in or out.
3. **Web2 Risk**: We use goplus API to check contract risk.
4. **General Info**: We monitor how much the top smart money is interacting with the protocol.

## Auto Withdrawal Execution

We provide an auto withdrawal execution feature when certain conditions are met. Fireblocks will initiate a transaction from the LP position to the whitelisted address when the conditions are met.

## Demo

For our EthDenver2023 hackathon submission, we will demo Algo Risk Terminal with PancakeSwap USDT-BNB, a stable asset.

Thank you for considering our submission. We are confident in the potential of Algo Risk Terminal and look forward to showcasing it further.
